# COVID19MX
This was a Coursera course assignment, it consisted in plot real data and make an analysis, here only will be provided the data and the code.
The information was obtained from https://datos.covid-19.conacyt.mx/#DownZCSV 
All the data is inonly one file with the date, so what I did was to separate the data for each year, from 2020 to 2023.
The code takes the data and plots it in only one graphic.
